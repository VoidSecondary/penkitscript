# penkitscript
Forked from (https://github.com/AlexisAhmed/BugBountyToolkit)
Very rough script to install pentesting tools. PRs would very much be appreciated.
If you have a tool that you would like to see installed in this script put up a pull request. This script has next to no customization apart from the seclists.
Customizations and custom parameters will be considered in the future.

Has to be run as a user with sudo permissions. with the command below to run as root with the home directory being the user.
sudo HOME=~ ./install.sh
